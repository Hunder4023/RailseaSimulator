## Purpose

This game was developed as part of my English Reading assignment.  
It’s a lightweight simulator that blends exploration, combat, and scavenging in a retro-inspired environment.  
Some gameplay elements require interaction through the terminal (bash), adding a hybrid experience between GUI and CLI.
